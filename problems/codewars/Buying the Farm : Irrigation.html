                            <h1 id="you-bought-the-farm">You Bought the Farm!</h1>
<p>Well, actually you just inherited the farm, after your grandfather bought the farm in darker and more figurative sense. The point is, you now have a farm, and you've decided to abandon your life as a programmer in the city and become a farmer instead.</p>
<p>It's a small farm with only a single field. Your grandfather had bought the equipment to irrigate it, but it was never installed, so that's your first order of business!</p>
<p>The equipment consists of a single sprinkler gun and a variable-speed pump. When active, the gun will turn, watering a circular area around it. The range of the gun can be controlled by varying the speed of the pump. </p>
<p>The problem: where do you position it, and what to do you set the range to, to ensure it covers the largest possible circular area within your farm? </p>
<h1 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h1>
<p>The field to be irrigated has 4 sides, and is defined by x,y coordinates of the four corners. The field may be any shape, so long as it is <a href="https://www.mathopenref.com/polygonconvex.html" target="_blank">convex</a>.</p>
<p>Your goal is to find largest circlular area that will fit within that quad.</p>
<p>Note that your neighbors look unfriendly and all seem to be well-armed, so to be safe, you should be sure not let the circle cross outside the field and into their property!</p>
<h3 id="function-header-and-arguments">Function Header and Arguments</h3>
<p>Coordinates are passed to your function as a single array of 8 floats, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for corners 0-3, in a clockwise order (on a plane where positive <code>y</code> is up and positive <code>x</code> is right)</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">[]<span class="cm-keyword">float64</span>{<span class="cm-variable">X1</span>,<span class="cm-variable">Y1</span>,<span class="cm-variable">X2</span>,<span class="cm-variable">Y2</span>,<span class="cm-variable">X3</span>,<span class="cm-variable">Y3</span>,<span class="cm-variable">X4</span>,<span class="cm-variable">Y4</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>Your main function prototype should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="cm-keyword">func</span> <span class="cm-variable">FitBiggestCircle</span>(<span class="cm-variable">coords</span> []<span class="cm-keyword">float64</span>) []<span class="cm-keyword">float64</span> { <span class="cm-number">.</span><span class="cm-number">.</span><span class="cm-number">.</span> }
</code></pre>
<h3 id="return-values">Return values</h3>
<p>You are expected to return a slice of float64's consisting of the center x, center y, and radius of the circle.</p>
<p>Only the radius will be tested, but both will be used to display a picture of your solution, like those with the examples below.</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>Squares are trivial, with radius being half the length of a side - of course, you'll have to prove the corners define a square, first!</p>
