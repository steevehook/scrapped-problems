                            <p>We search non-negative integer numbers, with at <strong>most</strong> 3 digits, such as the sum of the cubes of their digits is the number itself; we will call them "cubic" numbers.</p>
<pre><code>153 is such a "cubic" number : 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153
</code></pre>
<p>These "cubic" numbers of at most 3 digits are easy to find, even by hand, so they are "hidden" with other numbers and characters in a string. </p>
<p>The task is to find, or not, the "cubic" numbers in the string and then to make the <em>sum</em> of these "cubic" numbers found in the string, if any, and to return a string such as:</p>
<pre><code>"number1 number2 (and so on if necessary) sumOfCubicNumbers Lucky" 
</code></pre>
<p> if "cubic" numbers number1, number2, ... were found. </p>
<p> The numbers in the output are to be in the order in which they are encountered in the input string.</p>
<p> If no cubic numbers are found return the string: `"Unlucky"``.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>
<pre><code> - s = "aqdf&amp;0#1xyz!22[153(777.777" 
   the groups of at most 3 digits are 0 and 1 (one digit), 22 (two digits), 153, 777, 777 (3 digits)
   Only 0, 1, 153 are cubic and their sum is 154
   Return: "0 1 153 154 Lucky"

- s = "QK29a45[&amp;erui9026315"
  the groups are 29, 45, 902, 631, 5. None is cubic.
  Return: "Unlucky"
</code></pre>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In the string "001234" where 3 digits or more follow each other the first group to examine is "001" and the following is "234". If a packet of at most three digits has been taken, whether or not "cubic", it's over for that packet. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When a continuous string of digits exceeds 3, the string is split into groups of 3 from the left. The last grouping could have 3, 2 or 1 digits.</p>
<p>e.g "24172410" becomes 3 strings comprising "241", "724" and "10"</p>
<p>e.g "0785" becomes 2 strings comprising "078" and "5".</p>
</li>
