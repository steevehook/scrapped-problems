                            <p>Given a rational number n</p>
<p><code> n &gt;= 0, with denominator strictly positive</code>  </p>
<ul>
<li>as a string (example: "2/3" in Ruby, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, Go) </li>
<li>or as two strings (example: "2" "3" in Haskell, Java, CSharp, C++, Swift, Dart) </li>
<li>or as a rational or decimal number (example: 3/4, 0.67 in R) </li>
<li>or two integers (Fortran)</li>
</ul>
<p>decompose this number as a sum of rationals with numerators equal to one and without repetitions
(2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6 is correct but not 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3, 1/3 is repeated).</p>
<p>The algorithm must be "greedy", so at each stage the new rational obtained in the decomposition must have a denominator as small as possible. 
In this manner the sum of a few fractions in the decomposition gives a rather good approximation of the rational to decompose.</p>
<p>2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3 doesn't fit because of the repetition but also because the first 1/3 has a denominator bigger than the one in 1/2 
in the decomposition 2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
<p>(You can see other examples in "Sample Tests:")</p>
<pre><code>decompose("21/23") or "21" "23" or 21/23 should return 

["1/2", "1/3", "1/13", "1/359", "1/644046"] in Ruby, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, Haskell, Go

"[1/2, 1/3, 1/13, 1/359, 1/644046]" in Java, CSharp, C++, Dart

"1/2,1/3,1/13,1/359,1/644046" in C, Swift, R
</code></pre>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>The decomposition of 21/23 as</p>
<pre><code>21/23 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/13 + 1/598 + 1/897
</code></pre>
<p>is exact but don't fulfill our requirement because 598 is bigger than 359.
Same for </p>
<pre><code>21/23 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/23 + 1/46 + 1/69 (23 is bigger than 13)
or 
21/23 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/15 + 1/110 + 1/253 (15 is bigger than 13).
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>The rational given to decompose could be greater than one or equal to one, in which case the first "fraction" will be an integer (with an implicit denominator of 1). </p>
</li>
<li><p>If the numerator parses to zero the function "decompose" returns [] (or "",, or "[]").</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number could also be a decimal which can be expressed as a rational. </p>
