                            <p>A Noun Phrase is a phrase that can be replaced by a pronoun [he/she/it].</p>
<p>For example, in the sentence:</p>
<p><code>a girl ate the cookie</code></p>
<p>"A girl" is a Noun Phrase, so we can say "<strong>she</strong> ate the cookie." "The cookie" is also a Noun Phrase, so we can even say "<strong>she</strong> ate <strong>it</strong>."</p>
<p>Both of these Noun Phrases are made up of an auxialliary (aux) [the/a] followed by a Noun (N) [girl/cookie]. </p>
<p>More complicated Noun Phrases can also include an arbitrary number of adjectives (adj). For example:</p>
<p><code>a big tall scary girl ate the cookie</code> </p>
<p>where "big", "tall", and "scary" are all adjectives. </p>
<p>For our simplified model, we will define a Noun Phrase as an auxiliary, followed by 0 or more adjectives, followed by a Noun. </p>
<p>Write a function that takes a sentence (as a string of words separated by spaces), a list of pronouns, and a dictionary (maping words to the grammatical categories aux, adj, and N). Return the sentcnce with all Noun Phrases replaced by pronouns, in the order given.</p>
<p>Assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>sentences will contain only lower-case letters and spaces (no puctuation)</li>
<li>any words not inlcuded in the dictionary are not auxilliaries, adjectives, or nouns</li>
<li>the number of pronouns provided will be equal to the number of Noun Phrases in the sentence</li>
</ul>
