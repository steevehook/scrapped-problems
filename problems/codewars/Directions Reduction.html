<p>… a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too. </p>
<p>Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction <em>right away</em> is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!</p>
<h4 id="how-i-crossed-a-mountainous-desert-the-smart-way">How I crossed a <em>mountainous</em> desert the smart way.</h4>
<p>The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):</p>
<pre><code>["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
or
{ "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
or
[North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
</code></pre>
<p>You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and <em>immediately</em> "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place!
So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:</p>
<pre><code>["WEST"]
or
{ "WEST" }
or
[West]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="other-examples">Other examples:</h4>
<p>In <code>["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"]</code>, the direction <code>"NORTH" + "SOUTH"</code> is going north and coming back <em>right away</em>. </p>
<p>The path becomes <code>["EAST", "WEST"]</code>, now <code>"EAST"</code> and <code>"WEST"</code> annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is <code>[]</code> (nil in Clojure).</p>
<p>In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are <em>not</em> directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].</p>
<h4 id="task">Task</h4>
<p>Write a function <code>dirReduc</code> which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W&lt;-&gt;E or S&lt;-&gt;N <em>side by side</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Haskell version takes a list of directions with <code>data Direction = North | East | West | South</code>. </li>
<li>The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing. </li>
<li>The Rust version takes a slice of <code>enum Direction {North, East, West, South}</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not all paths can be made simpler. 
The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not <em>directly</em> opposite of each other and can't become such. Hence the result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].</li>
