                            <p>You know combinations: for example, 
if you take 5 cards from a 52 cards deck you have 2,598,960 different combinations.</p>
<p>In mathematics the number of x combinations you can take from a set of n elements
is called the binomial coefficient of n and x, or more often <code>n choose x</code>.
The formula to compute <code>m = n choose x</code> is: <code>m = n! / (x! * (n - x)!)</code>
where ! is the factorial operator.</p>
<p>You are a renowned poster designer and painter. You are asked to provide 6 posters 
all having the same design each in 2 colors. Posters must all have a different color combination and you have the choice of 4 colors: red, blue, yellow, green. 
How many colors can you choose for each poster?</p>
<p>The answer is two since <code>4 choose 2 = 6</code>. The combinations will be:
{red, blue}, {red, yellow}, {red, green}, {blue, yellow}, {blue, green}, {yellow, green}.</p>
<p>Now same question but you have 35 posters to provide and 7 colors available. How many colors for each poster?
If you take combinations <code>7 choose 2</code> you will get 21 with the above formula.
But 21 schemes aren't enough for 35 posters. If you take <code>7 choose 5</code> combinations you will get 21 too.
Fortunately if you take <code>7 choose 3</code> or <code>7 choose 4</code> combinations you get 35 and so each poster will have a different combination of
3 colors or 5 colors. You will take 3 colors because it's less expensive.</p>
<h4 id="hence-the-problem">Hence the problem:</h4>
<p>knowing <code>m</code> (number of posters to design), 
knowing <code>n</code> (total number of available colors), 
let us 
search <code>x</code> (number of colors for each poster so that each poster has a unique combination of colors and the number of combinations is exactly the same as the number of posters).</p>
<p><em>In other words</em> we must find <strong>x</strong> such as </p>
<p><code>n choose x = m (1)</code> </p>
<p>for a given m and a given n;
<code>m &gt;= 0 and n &gt; 0</code>. If many x are solutions give as result the smallest x.
It can happen that when m is given at random there are no x satisfying <code>equation (1)</code> then
return -1.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>
<pre><code>checkchoose(6, 4) --&gt; 2
checkchoose(4, 4) --&gt; 1
checkchoose(4, 2) --&gt; -1
checkchoose(35, 7) --&gt; 3
checkchoose(36, 7) --&gt; -1

a = 47129212243960
checkchoose(a, 50) --&gt; 20
checkchoose(a + 1, 50) --&gt; -1
