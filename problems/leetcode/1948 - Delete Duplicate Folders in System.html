You are given a 2D array <code>paths</code>, where <code>paths[i]</code> is an array representing an absolute path to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> folder in the file system.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, <code>["one", "two", "three"]</code> represents the path <code>"/one/two/three"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are <strong>identical</strong> if they contain the <strong>same non-empty</strong> set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders <strong>do not</strong> need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are <strong>identical</strong>, then <strong>mark</strong> the folders as well as all their subfolders.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, folders <code>"/a"</code> and <code>"/b"</code> in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should <strong>all</strong> be marked:

	<ul>
		<li><code>/a</code></li>
		<li><code>/a/x</code></li>
		<li><code>/a/x/y</code></li>
		<li><code>/a/z</code></li>
		<li><code>/b</code></li>
		<li><code>/b/x</code></li>
		<li><code>/b/x/y</code></li>
		<li><code>/b/z</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>However, if the file structure also included the path <code>"/b/w"</code>, then the folders <code>"/a"</code> and <code>"/b"</code> would not be identical. Note that <code>"/a/x"</code> and <code>"/b/x"</code> would still be considered identical even with the added folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will <strong>delete</strong> all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.</p>

<p>Return <em>the 2D array </em><code>ans</code> <em>containing the paths of the <strong>remaining</strong> folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in <strong>any</strong> order</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images/lc-dupfolder1.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 218px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["d"],["d","a"]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named "b".
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images/lc-dupfolder2.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 355px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The file structure is as shown. 
Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images/lc-dupfolder3.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 201px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images/lc-dupfolder4_.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 290px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> []
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an
empty folder named "y".
Folders "/a" and "/b" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder "z" and the folder "x" described above.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images/lc-dupfolder5_.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 282px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"],["b","w"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["b"],["b","w"],["b","z"],["a"],["a","z"]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> This has the same structure as the previous example, except with the added "/b/w".
Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" are still marked, but "/a" and "/b" are no longer marked because "/b" has the
empty folder named "w" and "/a" does not.
Note that "/a/z" and "/b/z" are not marked because the set of identical subfolders must be non-empty, but these folders are empty.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= paths.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= paths[i].length &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= paths[i][j].length &lt;= 10</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= sum(paths[i][j].length) &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>path[i][j]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
	<li>No two paths lead to the same folder.</li>
	<li>For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.</li>
</ul>
