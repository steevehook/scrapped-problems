<h2>Selective Amnesia</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 298</h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Larry and Robin play a memory game involving a sequence of random numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if his memory is full.</p>

<p>Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove:<br>
Larry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time.<br>
Robin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time.</p>

<p>Example game:</p>
