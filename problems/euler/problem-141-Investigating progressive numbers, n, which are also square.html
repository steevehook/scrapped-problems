<h2>Investigating progressive numbers, <i>n</i>, which are also square</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 141</h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>A positive integer, <i>n</i>, is divided by <i>d</i> and the quotient and remainder are <i>q</i> and <i>r</i> respectively. In addition <i>d</i>, <i>q</i>, and <i>r</i> are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p>For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can also be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio 3/2).<br>
We will call such numbers, <i>n</i>, progressive.</p>
<p>Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 102<sup>2</sup>, happen to also be perfect squares.<br> The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is 124657.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>).</p>
