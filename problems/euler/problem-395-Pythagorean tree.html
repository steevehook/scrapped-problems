<p>
The <b>Pythagorean tree</b> is a fractal generated by the following procedure:
</p>

<p>
Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the animation, the bottom side is the base):
</p><ol><li> Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5 ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the 'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).</li>
<li> Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its sides coinciding with that leg.</li>
<li> Repeat this procedure for both squares, considering as their bases the sides touching the triangle.</li>
</ol>
The resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the Pythagorean tree.

<p>
It can be shown that there exists at least one rectangle, whose sides are parallel to the largest square of the Pythagorean tree, which encloses the Pythagorean tree completely.
</p>
<p>
Find the smallest area possible for such a bounding rectangle, and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
