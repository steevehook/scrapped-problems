<h2>Geoboard Shapes</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 514</h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>A <b>geoboard</b> (of order <var>N</var>) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates 0 ≤ <var>x</var>,<var>y</var> ≤ <var>N</var>.</p>

<p>John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between 1 and <var>N</var>+1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.</p>

<p>After John is finished generating numbers for all (<var>N</var>+1)<sup>2</sup> holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let <var>S</var> represent the shape that is formed. <var>S</var> can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/p514_geoboard.png" alt="p514_geoboard.png"></div>

<p>The above image depicts a sample layout for <var>N</var> = 4. The green markers indicate positions where pins have been placed, and the blue lines collectively represent the rubberband. For this particular arrangement, <var>S</var> has an area of 6. If there are fewer than three pins on the board (or if all pins are collinear), <var>S</var> can be assumed to have zero area.</p>

<p>Let E(<var>N</var>) be the expected area of <var>S</var> given a geoboard of order <var>N</var>. For example, E(1) = 0.18750, E(2) = 0.94335, and E(10) = 55.03013 when rounded to five decimal places each.</p>

<p>Calculate E(100) rounded to five decimal places.</p>
