<h2>Nontransitive sets of dice</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 376</h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>
Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:
</p>

<p>
Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4<br>
Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5<br>
Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6<br></p>

<p>
A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.
</p>

<p>
If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get<br>
P(second player wins) = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>
If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get<br>
P(second player wins) = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>
If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get<br>
P(second player wins) = <sup>25</sup>/<sub>36</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>
So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.<br>
A set of dice having this property is called a <b>nontransitive set of dice</b>.
</p>

<p>
We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:</p><ul><li>There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and <var>N</var> pips, inclusive.</li>
<li>Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located.</li>
<li>The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins.</li>
<li>The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.</li>
</ul><p>
For <var>N</var> = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.<br>
How many are there for <var>N</var> = 30 ?
