<h2>Unbalanced Nim</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 488</h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing <b>Nim</b> every day. However, they finally got bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.<br>
So, they added an extra rule:</p>

<p>- Must not make two heaps of the same size.</p>

<p>The triple (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>) indicates the size of three heaps.<br>
Under this extra rule, (2,4,5) is one of the losing positions for the next player.</p>

<p>To illustrate:<br>
- Alice moves to (2,4,3)<br>
- Bob   moves to (0,4,3)<br>
- Alice moves to (0,2,3)<br>
- Bob   moves to (0,2,1)</p>

<p>Unlike ordinary three-heap Nim, (0,1,2) and its permutations are the end states of this game.</p>

<p>For an integer <var>N</var>, we define F(<var>N</var>) as the sum of <var>a</var>+<var>b</var>+<var>c</var> for all the losing positions for the next player, with 0 &lt; <var>a</var> &lt; <var>b</var> &lt; <var>c</var> &lt; <var>N</var>.</p>

<p>For example, F(8) = 42, because there are 4 losing positions for the next player, (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6) and (2,4,5).<br>
We can also verify that F(128) = 496062.</p>

<p>Find the last 9 digits of F(10<sup>18</sup>).</p>
