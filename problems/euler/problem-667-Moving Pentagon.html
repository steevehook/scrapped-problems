<h2>Moving Pentagon</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 667</h3></div>

<p>
After buying a <i>Gerver Sofa</i> from the <i>Moving Sofa Company</i>, Jack wants to buy a matching cocktail table from the same company. Most important for him is that the table can be pushed through his L-shaped corridor into the living room without having to be lifted from its table legs. <br>
Unfortunately, the simple square model offered to him is too small for him, so he asks for a bigger model.<br>
He is offered the new pentagonal model illustrated below:</p>

Note, while the shape and size can be ordered individually, due to the production process,<b> all edges of the pentagonal table have to have the same length.</b></p>
<p>
Given optimal form and size, what is the biggest pentagonal cocktail table (in terms of area) that Jack can buy that still fits through his unit wide L-shaped corridor?</p>
<p>
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point (if Jack had choosen the square model instead the answer would have been 1.0000000000).</p>
