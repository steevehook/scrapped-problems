<p><dfn>The Chase</dfn> is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.</p>

<p>The players sit around a table and the game begins with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.</p>

<p>If the player rolls 1, then the die passes to the neighbour on the left.<br>
If the player rolls 6, then the die passes to the neighbour on the right.<br>
Otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.</p>

<p>The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.</p>

<p>In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts?</p>
<p>Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.</p>
