<h2>Polar polygons</h2><div id="problem_info"><h3>Problem 465</h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>The <i>kernel</i> of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a <i>polar polygon</i> as a polygon for which the origin is <u>strictly</u> contained inside its kernel.</p>

<p>For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.</p>

<p>For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/p465_polygons.png" alt="p465_polygons.png"></p>


<p>Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.</p>

<p>Let P(<var>n</var>) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than <var>n</var>.</p>

<p>Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].</p>

<p>For example, P(1) = 131, P(2) = 1648531, P(3) = 1099461296175 and P(343) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007 = 937293740.</p>

<p>Find P(7<sup>13</sup>) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.</p>
